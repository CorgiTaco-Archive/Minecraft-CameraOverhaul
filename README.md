**A better description may be available at [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/camera-overhaul-forge)**

### What's this?!
A forge port of a fabric clientside mod that attempts to improve overall satisfaction of the game through the introduction of various camera rotations, to emphasize on the player's movement and improve visual feedback. Strafing and turning around will tilt the camera sideways. Jumping, falling, and moving forward/backwards will affect the camera's pitch.

### Is this for Forge, or Fabric?
This mod is for forge, you may find the fabric version here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cameraoverhaul.

### Can I turn off X and only keep Y?
You can find the configuration file with intensity scaling for all features at `.minecraft/config/cameraoverhaul.json`. Set a factor to 0.0 to turn the feature off. You can also use negative numbers there, if that's your thing.
